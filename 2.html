    <h2 id="suri-program-at-university-of-saskatchewanusask">2019 SURI Program at the University of Saskatchewan(USASK)</h2>
<p>In the summer 2019, I got a chance to be an intern at University of Saskatchewan(USASK) under Summer University Research Initiative (SURI-2019). I worked on the Brownian Dynamics Modelling for the Narrow Escape Problem in the case of the unit sphere under the guidance of Dr. Alexey Shevyakov(<a href="mailto:shevyakov@math.usask.ca">shevyakov@math.usask.ca</a>). Narrow escape problem considers the calculation of the mean first passage time (MFPT) required for a Brownian particle to escape a given domain through one of the finitely many small boundary windows, or traps.</p>
<p>Narrow escape problems arise in a variety of physical settings, including multiple cell-biological applications, such as Receptor Trafficking in a synaptic membrane, and RNA transport from the cell nucleus through the nuclear pores. A model describing the MFPT as a solution of a Poisson partial differential equation (PDE) problem has been suggested and analyzed in the recent literature <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The goal of our work was to perform a direct numerical simulation of multiple particles undergoing Brownian motion in a spherical 3D domain with boundary traps, to compute MFPT values by averaging of Brownian escape times, and to compare the results with those predicted by approximate solutions of the MFPT PDE problem.The current study was aiming at understanding aspects of the narrow escape kinetics that could not be extracted from averaged MFPT values. We were interested in knowing how many single-particle simulations are required to match the predicted asymptotic averaged MFPT values closely. Second, having multiple simulated Brownian particle trajectories at our Disposal. It was of interest to study boundary dynamics of Brownian particle. As a result of this Summer project, efficient MATLAB-based code was developed, able to model and collect 3D trajectories of Brownian particles starting from a given point up to their escape through a given trap, taking into account boundary reflections rigorously.</p>
<p>A comprehensive study of results obtained from the simulations shows that the asymptotic results for the escape times are within 1% accuracy even when the radius of the boundary trap is small. <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>0</mn><mn>4</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^4</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.814108em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">0</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.814108em;"><span class="" style="top: -3.063em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">4</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> runs are required for computing escape time from the simulations for the boundary trap having radius <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0.01</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.01</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.64444em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">.</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span></span>. Moreover, for a spherical domain with one small trap at the north pole, Brownian particle spend about 3 seconds near the boundary when launched from different starting locations.</p>
<h2 id="current-research">Master's Research</h2>
<p>In my thesis project, I studied the effects of strongly localized perturbation on the solution of the eigenvalue problem<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. The study of these problem helps us in understanding the various physical and biological problems, including Narrow Escape problem. We aim to study the qualitative analysis of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the narrow escape problem. It will be interesting to study the properties like isolatedness, regularity and simplicity associated with these eigenpairs.</p>
