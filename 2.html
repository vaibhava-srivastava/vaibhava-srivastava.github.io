      My primary research interests lie at the intersection of differential equations and mathematical biology. I specialize in investigating various qualitative properties of population dynamics models in ecology. Specifically, I focus on exploring the impact of fear on Lotka-Volterra-type competition models. Fear is a crucial factor in the behavior of many species, and it can have a significant effect on their competitive interactions. Through studying the role of fear in these models, I aim to gain insight into the complex dynamics of biological systems.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Wildwest;" class="more-content">
      In addition to my work on competition models, I also explore the Chemotactic Diffusion System, a mathematical model that describes the spatiotemporal evolution of two biological species in a competitive scenario. This system is especially relevant to understanding the competition for limited resources between bacterial populations. By analyzing the dynamics of this system, I hope to gain further understanding of how different species interact and compete in real-world ecological settings.

    <p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;">
      
Non-consumptive effects, such as fear of depredation, can strongly influence predator-prey dynamics. There are several ecological and social motivations for these effects in competitive systems as well. In this work, we consider the classic two species ODE and PDE Lotka-Volterra competition models, where one of the competitors is "fearful" of the other. We find that the presence of fear can have several interesting dynamical effects on the classical competitive scenarios. Notably, for fear levels in certain regimes, we show novel bi-stability dynamics. Furthermore, in the spatially explicit setting, the effects of several spatially heterogeneous fear functions are investigated.  In particular, we show that under certain integral restrictions on the fear function, a weak competition-type situation can change to competitive exclusion. Applications of these results to ecological as well as sociopolitical settings are discussed, which connect to the  "landscape of fear" (LOF) concept in ecology. Using the test case of northern spotted and barred owl populations in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, we evaluate if this fear (co-occurrence) model can generate more robust population estimates than previous models. We then evaluate if potential co-occurrence effects among barred and northern spotted owls are uni- or bi-directional. Lastly, we leverage the best-performing model to evaluate the degree to which a recently proposed barred owl culling program may help recover northern spotted owl populations.

<h3 id="suri" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;color: #FF3371;">&#9758; Model-informed optimal allocation of limited resources to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks in societies at war</h3>   
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;"> Societies at war are particularly affected by infectious disease outbreaks, necessitating the development of mathematical models tailored to the intricacies of war and disease dynamics as valuable tools for policy-makers. The frequently limited availability of public health resources, such as drugs or medical personnel, yields a fundamental optimal allocation problem. This study frames this problem in a generic, modifiable context and proposes model-informed solutions by identifying allocation strategies that minimize disease burden, measured by total deaths or infections. The desynchronization of epidemic peaks among a heterogeneous population emerges as a general disease mitigation strategy. Moreover, the level of contact heterogeneity proves to substantially affect disease spread and optimal control. </p>

    <h3 id="suri" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;color: #FF3371;">&#9758; Exploring unique dynamics in a predator–prey model with generalist predator and group defense in prey</h3>   
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;"> This study examines a predator-prey model where the predator follows a generalist Leslie-Gower framework, and the prey employs group defense strategies. A key innovation introduced is the simultaneous occurrence of predator population "blow-up" (rapid growth) and prey population "quenching" (sharp decline) within a finite time. Despite this sharp decline, the prey population remains bounded. This simultaneous blow-up and quenching dynamic mirrors real-world phenomena, such as the surge in Burmese python populations in the Florida Everglades and the concurrent decline in mammalian prey species. </p>

    <h3 id="suri" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;color: #FF3371;">&#9758; Dynamical Analysis of a Lotka-Volterra Competition Model with both Allee and Fear Effect</h3>   
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;"> In this work, we explored the impact of both density-dependent (Allee effect) and non-consumptive, behavioral (fear effect) processes in a two-species competitive system using ODE and PDE models. We showed that while the Allee and fear effects alter extinction dynamics and the number of positive equilibria, they do not affect their stability. The combination of both effects can shift the system's competitive outcomes, especially for small fear levels, leading to qualitative changes like stronger competition or bi-stability. For large fear, the Allee effect reinforces fear-driven dynamics. The findings have implications for conservation, biological control, and biodiversity preservation. </p>

<h3 id="suri" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;color: #FF3371;">&#9758; Brownian dynamics simulations for the narrow escape problem in the unit sphere</h3>   


<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;">This work focuses on the narrow escape problem of calculating the time needed for a Brownian particle to leave a domain with localized absorbing boundary traps. The mean first-passage time (MFPT) is modeled by a Poisson partial differential equation and the objective is to perform direct numerical simulations of multiple particles and compare the results with the Poisson equation-based continuum model. The simulations validate the model and also provide additional insights into particle dynamics that cannot be captured in a continuum approach. The Poisson equation-based continuum model's validation is achieved through 10<sup>4</sup> particle runs. Additional insights into particle dynamics, such as isotropic vs. anisotropic diffusion effects, are gained through direct simulations.</p>

<h3 id="suri" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;color: #FF3371;">&#9758; Dynamical Analysis of an Allelopathic Phytoplankton Model with Fear Effect</h3>   
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;"> This paper is the first to propose an allelopathic phytoplankton competition ODE model influenced by the fear effect based on natural biological phenomena. It is shown that the interplay of this fear effect and the allelopathic term cause rich dynamics in the proposed competition model, such as global stability, transcritical bifurcation, pitchfork bifurcation, and saddle-node bifurcation. We also consider the spatially explicit version of the model and prove analogous results. Numerical simulations verify the feasibility of the theoretical analysis. The results demonstrate that the primary cause of the extinction of non-toxic species is the fear of toxic species compared to toxins. Allelopathy only affects the density of non-toxic species. The discussion guides the conservation of species and the maintenance of biodiversity. </p>

 <h3 id="suri" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;color: #FF3371;">&#9758; Stability and bifurcation analysis of a two-patch model with the Allee effect and dispersal</h3>   
<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;"> In the current manuscript, a two-patch model with the Allee effect and nonlinear dispersal is presented. We study both the ordinary differential equation (ODE) case and the partial differential equation (PDE) case here. In the ODE model, the stability of the equilibrium points and the existence of saddle-node bifurcation are discussed. The phase diagram and bifurcation curve of our model are also given as a results of numerical simulation. Besides, the corresponding linear dispersal case is also presented. We show that, when the Allee effect is large, high intensity of linear dispersal is not favorable to the persistence of the species. We further show when the Allee effect is large, nonlinear diffusion is more beneficial to the survival of the population than linear diffusion. Moreover, the results of the PDE model extend our findings from discrete patches to continuous patches. </p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Wildwest;">For my thesis, I investigated how strongly localized perturbations affect the solution of the eigenvalue problem, which has applications in understanding physical and biological phenomena such as the Narrow Escape problem. Specifically, I focused on analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this problem, with a particular interest in properties such as isolatedness, regularity, and simplicity that are associated with these eigenpairs.</p>
