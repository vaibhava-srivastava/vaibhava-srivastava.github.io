   <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="computer-skills">Computer Skills</h1>
<p> I have been working with MATLAB and Wolfram Mathematica, two popular numerical computing environments, for the past five years. These tools have been invaluable for my research as well as laboratory and practical work across a range of graduate and undergraduate courses.<\p>
<p> My extensive experience with MATLAB and Mathematica has given me a deep understanding of their capabilities and how to use them effectively. I believe that this expertise will enable me to work more efficiently on my current research project.<\p>
<p> In addition to these tools, I am also proficient in programming languages such as C++ and Python. With Python, I have worked with various scientific and numerical computation libraries, including SciPy and NumPy. To further enhance my skills, I recently took an option course in Python Programming to refresh my knowledge of the basics and stay up-to-date with the latest developments.<\p>
<p> Overall, my proficiency in these technical tools and programming languages equips me with a strong foundation to tackle complex research problems and produce high-quality results.
